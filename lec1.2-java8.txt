1. what is Java Stream API?
ans: A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. The following example illustrates an aggregate operation using Stream and IntStream:

	i) Nothing to do with existing I/O stream.
	ii) Its not data structure, uses data structure, does not change data structure.
	iii) intermediate operations are Lazy evaluation and returns streams.
	iv) For parallel processing, many implementations are available.
for example - map(),reduce(),filter(),forEach() etc.
	v) Example.
	//numbers.stream().map(x -> x+1).forEach(i -> System.out.println(i));
	int result = numbers.stream().reduce((x,y) -> x+y).get();
	//System.out.println(result);
		
	numbers.stream().filter(x -> x%2==0).forEach(i -> System.out.println(i));

2) changes in collection related to stream?
ans: i) stream() - Returns a sequential Stream with this collection as its source.
    ii) stream
