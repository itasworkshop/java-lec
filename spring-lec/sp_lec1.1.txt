Spring Overview
- Apps are made up of different components(beans), those to be created and introducded to each other. Spring Application context(container) creates and manages these components.

- DI pattern wires these components(beans) together through constructor argument or property accessor methods.
- AC --> InventoryService and ProductService

- XML was used to create and wire beans.
- Nowadays java based config.
- @Configuration - cl
- @Bean - ml

- Component scanning
spring automatically scans components from classpath and create them as beans.

- Autowiring
spring automatically injects components for DI

- spring boot offers more auto-configurations based on classpath, env variables etc.

- MyApp project structure
- mvnw and mvnw.cmd - maven wrapper scripts used to build without maven intalled.
- POM.xml maven build specification.
- JAR packaging for cloud and WAR for server deployment.
- @SpringBootApplication - cl
- run()
	bootstrapes application and create AC, takes config class and cmd args.
- @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) -cl
	- junit annotation provides test runner which helps junit running a test
	- even empty @Test -ml will make sure AC is loaded successfully.
	- SpringRunner - spring provided test runner, that provides AC to run test.

- Spring MVC
-controller - a class that handles request and responds with information.
